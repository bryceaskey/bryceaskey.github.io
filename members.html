                <h2>Jeongim Kim</h2>
                <h4>Principal investigator</h4>
                <p>Dr. Kim is an assistant professor in the Horticultural Sciences Department and a member of the Plant Molecular and
                    Cellular Biology (PMCB) graduate program. She recieved her PhD at Purdue University studying auxin biosynthesis and 
                    plant abiotic stress physiology. During her post-doctoral training at Purdue, she studied phenylpropanoid biosynthesis
                    and engaged in several projects aiming to increase biofuel production. She is interested in understanding molecular mechanisms
                    underlying the integration of metabolic networks and plant stress responses and/or growth.

                <h2>Veronica Perez</h2>
                <h4>Graduate student</h4>
                <p>Veronica is a PhD candidate of the Plant Molecular and Cell Biology program. Her interests lie in plant secondary metabolism, and
                    specifically in understanding the role of amino acid-derived metabolites known as aldoximes. Currently she is studying the role and
                    mechanisms of aldoxime-derived auxin biosynthesis in several model plant species as well as characterizing the outcomes of aldoxime metabolism
                    in non-Brassicales species. When not in the lab, she spends her time walking, listening to podcasts, and playing with her cat.

                <h4>Undergraduate student</h4>
                <p>Bryce is an undergraduate student pursuing a dual degree in Biological Engineering and Horticultural Science. He is interested in 
                applying systems biology methods to further our understanding of plant biochemistry, and especially its underlying regulatory
                mechanisms. Currently he is working with a variety of <i>Scutellaria</i> species to characterize their diversity in accumulation of
                medicinally active metabolites. Outside of the lab, he enjoys biking around Gainesville, cooking, and baking sourdough bread.
